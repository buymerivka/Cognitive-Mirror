We should focus on the harassment and make sure that everyone understands what is going on and these people are being victimized. Clearly the laws in Sudan are not strong enough and the problem is not taken seriously enough. We need to become loud on this issue and make sure the government in Sudan understands their approach must be changed.

Yes, I can see the Indigenous population not wanting all these outsiders trampling all over their land and creating many problems.

No one really knows what is going on because there is so much not being talked about since it's not allowed or gets shut down. Remember what Chinese actor Jimmy Yang once said on this topic, \"The point of information is to be shared and not silenced.\" From what I understand, Jimmy didn't even live in China and grew up in Australia and only visited China and was mostly away from Chinese oppressive regime. So how much faith can we really put into his words? This is a really complex situation and the more these governments clamp down, the more voices are quieted. Shouldn't authorities realize that their actions could be causing more harm than good?",

A star is a public figure and should be private about what they say. Letting their political views out is kind of like letting a cat out of a bag. Of course, people want to know opinions and thoughts but the natural need to know sometimes can harm people... especially if it is an idea they do not agree with. People will instinctively go into defense mode if they see it as an offensive opinion in their own attempt to protect their belief. The escalation alone isn't worth it. Don't you agree that it is just fanning the flames of discord?",

Yet, the continued support for products and celebrities perpetuating such propaganda indicates a scary trend. Today, it might be just tolerance for a movie actor's stance, but if we continue down this slope, we might end up disturbingly desensitized to propaganda in all forms. Tomorrow, it could be a global acceptance of oppressive regimes and disregard for human rights, all under the veil of patriotism and nationalistic belief. It's a slippery slope, folks!",
